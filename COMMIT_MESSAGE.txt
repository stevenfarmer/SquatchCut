refactor: simplify codebase - remove unused features and consolidate docs

Phase 1: Remove Unused Code (~2,000 lines)
- Delete genetic algorithm system (genetic_nesting.py, 497 lines)
- Delete grain direction system (grain_direction.py, ~300 lines)
- Delete 6 test files for removed features (~1,200 lines)
- Remove genetic algorithm flags from session_state
- Clean up references in csv_import, csv_loader, quality_assurance
- Fix ruff linting issues (import sorting)

Phase 3: Consolidate Documentation
- Create DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (single source of truth)
- Archive AGENTS.md and Project_Guide_v3.3.md to docs/archive/
- Delete meta-documentation (constraints inventory, pain points analysis)
- Update README.md and test references
- Simplify from 4+ docs to 1 essential guide

Impact:
- Removed 2,500+ lines total (code + docs)
- All 584 tests passing
- Clearer architecture and constraints
- Single source of truth for developers
- Historical docs preserved in archive

The genetic algorithm and grain direction systems were:
- Not exposed in UI (hidden features)
- Only accessible via session flags
- Adding complexity without user value

Documentation consolidation:
- Removed constraint framework overhead
- Extracted essential rules only
- Improved accessibility and clarity
