feat: replace SVG internal labels with legend and optional leader lines

User feedback indicated that internal part labels were problematic:
- Labels crossed into adjacent parts on small pieces
- Font sizing was inconsistent
- Labels cluttered the layout

New approach:
- NO internal labels on parts (clean layout)
- Legend at bottom of SVG (always shown when labels enabled)
- Optional leader lines for small parts (user toggle in export options)
- SVG viewBox automatically adjusts to accommodate legend space
- Dimensions can be shown in legend (controlled by include_dimensions)

Changes:
- freecad/SquatchCut/core/exporter.py:
  * Removed internal label rendering code (~70 lines)
  * Added legend rendering with optional dimensions
  * Added leader lines support for small parts
  * Adjusted SVG viewBox to include legend space
  * Updated export_nesting_to_svg() to accept include_leader_lines parameter

- freecad/SquatchCut/gui/taskpanel_main.py:
  * Added "Include leader lines" checkbox in export options
  * Wired up leader lines preference save/load
  * Pass include_leader_lines to export function

- freecad/SquatchCut/core/preferences.py:
  * Added get_export_include_leader_lines() method
  * Added set_export_include_leader_lines() method

- backlog.md:
  * Updated SVG label issue status to reflect final solution

All export tests passing (18/18). Total test suite: 557 passed, 13 skipped.
