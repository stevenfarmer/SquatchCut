# Feedback, Bugs, and Feature Requests

If you run into a problem with SquatchCut or have an idea to make it better, you’re in the right place.

## Bug reports

Use a **bug report** when something is broken or clearly wrong, for example:
- Crashes or errors
- Parts overlapping unexpectedly
- Layouts that don’t match the input
- UI elements that don’t respond or behave strangely

**Where to report bugs:**
- GitHub Issues (Bug report template):  
  https://github.com/stevenfarmer/SquatchCut/issues/new/choose

When you open a bug, it helps a lot if you include:

- What you were trying to do  
  e.g., “Import CSV and run nesting on a 4x8 sheet using imperial units”
- Steps to reproduce:
  1. Open FreeCAD
  2. Open SquatchCut
  3. Import CSV `<filename>`
  4. Set sheet size to `...`
  5. Click **Preview SquatchCut**
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened (including any error messages)
- Attachments (if possible):
  - The CSV file you used
  - Screenshots of the layout or error
  - Your FreeCAD version
  - Your SquatchCut version
  - Whether you used metric or imperial units, and CSV units

You can also use the **“Report a Bug”** button in the SquatchCut Task Panel inside FreeCAD to open the issue tracker directly in your browser.

## Feature requests and enhancements

Use a **feature request** when:
- You’d like SquatchCut to do something it doesn’t do today
- You want a workflow improvement or UX tweak
- You have an idea for a new option, setting, export, or visualization

**Where to request features:**
- GitHub Issues (Feature request template):  
  https://github.com/stevenfarmer/SquatchCut/issues/new/choose

When requesting a feature, please include:

- What problem you’re trying to solve  
  e.g., “I want to print labeled cut sheets for my cabinet shop”
- How you work today (manual process, other tools, etc.)
- What an ideal solution in SquatchCut would look like
- Any example screenshots or attachments that help explain it

Even small ideas are welcome; they help shape the roadmap.
